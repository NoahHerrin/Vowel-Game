# Vowel-Game
The goal of this project was to challenge myself to create a game using the nodeJS runtime and to gain a deeper understanding
of how web applications work. 

## The Rules of The Game
Insert consonants inbetween a set of given vowels in order to create words. Currently the goal is to create as many words as
you can in a minute.
